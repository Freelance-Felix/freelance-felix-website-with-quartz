# **How Do I Know What Engine To Use?**
With so many engines to choose from it can be hard to know! You can also just tell me your game requirements and I'll let you know what options will work well, but here's my general
advice:
 
**[Unity](https://unity.com/)**: Very diverse engine and can handle basically anything. It dominates the mobile and indie game market. It has tons of resources making it easy to use in most cases. In most cases, I recommend Unity. It's free until you make a certain amount of money, which you can read more about on their website.
 
**[Godot](https://godotengine.org/)**: Up and coming engine that can already handle desktop games very well. It's great for 2D and can handle 3D, generally more cartoony styles. Not ideal for mobile as of writing this, especially 3D. It's multiplayer also isn't as developed as something like Unity so for multiplayer heavy games (MMO) that's something to take into account. You can port to consoles through third-party services like W4 games for a yearly fee. In terms of costs, it's completely free and doesn't take a cut of your games revenue at all.
 
**[Unreal](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US)**: Can be ideal for 3D games with STUNNING graphics. Not recommended for 2D with it's lack of 2D support. It's also really only meant for PCs and consoles, not mobile. No royalties have to be paid until you make $1,000,000 dollars.
 
**[Gamemaker Studio 2](https://gamemaker.io/en)**: A decent engine for 2D games. In my experience It can be more limiting in some cases, but it depends what you want out of your game.
 
**[Defold](https://defold.com/)**: A less well known engine that's built initially for mobiles games, but can also handle web games, desktop and even console games well. Can be a great option for mobile development specifically. Just like Godot it's open source and completely free (except for console exports).
 
**Frameworks ([Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news), [Love2D](https://love2d.org/), [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/), [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/), [Monogame](https://monogame.net/) etc.)**: Frameworks are generally completely free to use and allows for the most customization as you have access to all the source code. It can be useful if you're trying to make a very specific game that no other engine really fits your needs. More ideal for 2D games then 3D, but you can also do 3D with a framework. If for some reason you don't want to use an engine, then you can look into frameworks. I really only recommend it for 2D games though and stick to an engine for 3D games.

# **What Is A GDD?**
A GDD is known as a Game Design Document. It's like the bible to your game. If anyone has any questions or forgets something the GDD probably has it. It includes all the details about your game like your target demographic, UI, monetization and most importantly all your games mechanics. [Here](https://minoqi.itch.io/minos-gddgdc-template) is a template I've made that you can use for free.

# **How Much Does Making A Game Cost?**
The cost of a games development will vary widely on the game. Things like the target platform, art style and complexity are all things that will change the price of a game. Especially things like multiplayer, as you often have to pay for a server if you want your game to work off of steam, or online databases to store players data to sync across devices (mostly for mobile).

For reference, my starting price is often around $10k, but smaller/quicker games can be closer to $5k. This includes just the programming and does not take into account the costs of art, design, audio, translations (if needed), store fees (Steam costs $100 per game, Apple is $100 per year), engine fees etc. Things like your advertisement budget and having your own website if wanted are also areas you need to consider. _Don't skimp on marketing, it's very important!_

# **How Long Will My Game Take?**
The development time of a game will vary widely on the game. 6 months to a year is often a good estimate for most games. If you're using game assets then that can speed up the process and simple mobile games often are much quicker.
