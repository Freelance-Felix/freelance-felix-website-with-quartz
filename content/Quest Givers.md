> "For my first fiverr purchase I didn't really know what to expect with the whole freelance thing. I Went in hoping for a 40 minute clip to be made shorter : 5 mins or so. I got that, sure, but I also came out genuinely laughing aloud at my own, relatively tame commentary/jokes - partially because of level the editing surpassed expectations! It genuinely caught me off guard. Between the high quality product and the great communication (despite the UK-US time difference) this is definitely a service I'll proudly promote and credit in the uploaded product! It pays to pay! Dont buy into the false perception that the cheapest seller is a good idea just because it looks like they can do the $5"
