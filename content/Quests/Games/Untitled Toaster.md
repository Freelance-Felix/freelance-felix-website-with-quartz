Untitled Toaster is a 2D shooter where you play as a toaster fighting an onslaught of kitchen appliances/utensils. A prototype for the game idea was made for my Game Production I class. It was made in Unity 2D.

You can play itÂ [here](https://minoqi.itch.io/untitled-toaster-prototype).

# What I Did
Being the lead programmer on the team I was in charge of a lot of things like helping others fix git issues, creating builds and keeping up the communication mainly between the designers and the programmers. I also was in charge of creating everything in the game outside of the AI. I coded in the player movement & attack system, UI and the level system.
