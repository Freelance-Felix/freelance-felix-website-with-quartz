Your Forever Home is a 3D metroidvania style psychological horror puzzle game. The initial prototype was made in a week. The game made it through greenlight and a beta version of the game was made throughout the rest of the semester. You play as a dog from an old pet care game, trying to escape into the real world so you can see your owner again. It was made in Unity 3D.

You can play the prototype [here](https://minoqi.itch.io/your-forever-home-prototype) and the beta [here](https://minoqi.itch.io/your-forever-home-beta).

# What I Did
During the prototype stage I was the only programmer so did all the programming which includes the movement, original camera system, interactable system and the game loop.

When we passed greenlight I became the lead programmer after we took on 2 more programmers and spent a lot of my time fixing bugs, git issues, creating builds and communicating between designers and programmers.
