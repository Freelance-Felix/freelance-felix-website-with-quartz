Warplight Wanderer is a 3D puzzle exploration game with platformer elements designed to be an overall calming experience, with the puzzles being not too difficult. It was made during the first semester of my senior year for my capstone class. I was in charge of putting together the systems, helping out with making/implementing sound effects, making a song track for the levels as well as designing/implementing the journal UI. It was made in Unity 3D for PC.

# What I Did
**Tools Programming:** Created a dialogue tool designers used to create branching dialogue with choices in the game.

**Systems Programming:** Put together the systems for the stars & sockets communicating with each other, as well as having the journal and other UI update accordingly.

**Sound & Music:** In terms of music I created the soundtrack heard while playing a level. For sound I recorded the sound effects used for opening/closing/flipping through the journal, made sure the walking sound effects lined up with how the player moved as well as found & implemented the sound effects used for the walking, journal UI and picking up/placing a star on the ground.

**UI Design:** Designed the layout and concept for the journal UI as well as implemented it in-game.

**Video Editing:** Lastly, I edited and put together the trailer for the game.
