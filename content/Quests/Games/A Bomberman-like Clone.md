“Bomberman Clone” is a 2D Godot mobile game designed for the iPhone/Android. You play as two characters each with their own ability. Both can place bombs, but one can place bombs that kill an enemy while the others bomb destroys walls. The goal is to get to the treasure in every level. I was hired to program the entire game.

*This game was made as a personal project for the client, so unfortunately the game is unavailable to play.*

# What I Did
**Programming:** Being the sole programmer I programmed everything about the game which includes the character controls, enemy system, bomb system, loot system, treasure system, levels and a the UI.

**Art:** I helped find art assets to use in the game as well as made some of the animations including the stars in the title screen (done with traditional methods) and the images that appear between levels and at the end of the game as well as the bomb ticking which were done with code.

**Other:** Being that this game was made for a gift for my clients friend, I gave them resources so they could download the game directly onto their phone and not have to worry about paying/getting it onto the app store.
