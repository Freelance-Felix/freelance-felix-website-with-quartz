“Flying Pegasus” is a 2D Godot mobile game designed for the iPhone/Android. You can choose from a list of characters to play and try to last as long as you can, tapping on the screen to jump and avoid running into clouds. I was hired to program the prototype as well as help discuss game design concepts and find artists.

You can try out the prototype [here](https://illusionarrays.itch.io/temppegasusprototype).

# What I Did
**Programming:** Being the sole programmer I programmed everything about the game which includes the flying system (which was made to work on mobile and computer), the random cloud generation, character selection, score system and UI.

**Game Design:** I helped discuss game design ideas with the client including a system for the characters, cloud pattern types and balancing.
