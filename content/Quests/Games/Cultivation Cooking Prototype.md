“Cultivation Cooking” is a 2D Godot mobile game designed for the iPhone/Android. You have to mix ingredients to stop them from floating to the top, cut the ingredients and throw out the disposable piece as well as keep the heat above a threshold. I was hired to program the prototype.

# What I Did
**Programming:** Being the sole programmer I programmed everything about the game which includes the stirring mechanic, cutting ingredients mechanic, throwing out ingredients mechanic, floating mechanic and heat mechanic. I also programmed a basic UI as well as a basic animation for the fire (done with code).
