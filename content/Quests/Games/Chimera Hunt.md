Chimera is a 2D Unity mobile game designed for the iPhone and was developed to go alongside a book. You play as Dimitire and Ilulia while exploring a world that gives more info on the book it’s from. I was hired to finish up the programming of the game, polish the pre-existing code, optimize it for mobile, help with the UI design and help with publishing on the app store/getting a QR code into the book.

You can get it on the app store [here](https://apps.apple.com/gy/app/chimera-hunt/id1613717729?platform=iphone).

# What I Did
**Programming:** For programming I did a mix of fixing bugs, optimization for mobile and implementing missing functions. The functions I implemented were the two dialogue systems, scene loading and the chimera following the player. Some bugs I fixed include clipping/layering issues and game objects disappearing at runtime.

**UI Design:** I did a few updates on the UI design of the game as well including adjusting the way characters looked, adjusting the layout of the dialogue scene and updated UI seen in-game.

**Production:** I helped walkthrough the client get their app published on the app store as well as create a QR code that’s placed in the book to take the user to the app store. The client was also very interested in learning more about programming in Unity, so I created an instruction document that goes over how the different scripts I made work.
